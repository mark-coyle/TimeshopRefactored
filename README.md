# Timeshop Refactored

This is the refactored version of my Timeshop repo. This refactored version has been updated to follow a better application layout, using the proposed layout from [Miguel Grinberg](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg) in his [tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xv-a-better-application-structure) on using Flask.

The project itself is a simple Flask based application that uses Jinja as its templating tool, and flask_mysqldb as an orm.

This project was completed as part of a college assignment and proved to be my first introduction into using python and Flask.
